# SLICES-RI blueprint

SLICES RI is defined as a scientific instrument to support the discovery process 
related to the future, emerging digital infrastructures.
It is a joint investment between the EU and the member states, on the ESFRI[[^refESFRI]]roadmap since 2021.

SLICES avoids fragmentation and achieves critical mass by bringing together research communities related to 
networking protocols, radio technologies, data
collection, parallel and distributed computing and in particular cloud and
edge-based computing architectures and services.

SLICES is a flexible platform designed to support large-scale, experimental
research focused on all domains related to digital infrastructures [[^slices]], [[^slices2]].

As opposed to similar initiatives worldwide, SLICES is sustainable with a roadmap defined until 2040.

The SLICES blueprint is aimed at sharing the same vision and solutions 
among the partners as well as proposing a plan for the design and deployment of SLICES RI.

In this blueprint we propose to define the infrastructure baseline augmented
with a reference implementation, which aims at keeping a focus on the goals of
the project, yet identifying technological challenges and breakthrough at the
early stage of the process. The blueprint shall be deployed by the SLICES-RI partners and 
will provide the baseline service that will be exposed to the experimenters when SLICES will move
into the operation phase (continuous integration and deployment strategy that will start mid 2024).

This blueprint is meant to continuously evolve in order to onboard lessons learned and
recommendations from the community, both academia and industry.
